![Overall structure of AutoBuild](img/agent_autobuild.png)

**TL;DR:**
Introducing **AutoBuild**, building multi-agent system automatically, fast, and easily for complex tasks with minimal
user prompt required, powered by a new designed class **AgentBuilder**. AgentBuilder also support open-source LLMs by
leveraging [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).

## Introduction
In this blog, we introduce **AutoBuild**, a pipeline that can automatically build multi-agent system for complex task.
Specifically, we design a new class called **AgentBuilder**, which will complete the generation of participant expert agents
and the construction of group chat automatically after the user provide descriptions of a building task and a execution task.

AgentBuilder support open-source models on Hugging Face powered by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html)
and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Once the user choose to use open-source LLM, AgentBuilder will set
up an endpoint server automatically without any user participant.

## Installation
- AutoGen:
```bash
pip install pyautogen==0.2.0b5
```
- (Optional: if you want to use open-source LLMs) vLLM and FastChat
```bash
pip install vllm fastchat
```

## Basic Example
In this section, we provide a step-by-step example of how to use AgentBuilder to build a multi-agent system for a specific task.

### Step 1: prepare configurations
First, we need to prepare the Agent configurations.
Specifically, a config path containing model name and api key, and a default config for each agent, are required.
```python
config_path = '/home/elpis_ubuntu/LLM/autogen/OAI_CONFIG_LIST'  # modify path
default_llm_config = {
    'temperature': 0
}
```

### Step 2: create a AgentBuilder instance
Then, we create a AgentBuilder instance with the config path and default config.
You can also specific the builder model and agent model, which are the LLMs used for building and agent respectively.
```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.agent_builder import AgentBuilder

builder = AgentBuilder(config_path=config_path, builder_model='gpt-4-1106-preview', agent_model='gpt-4-1106-preview')
```

### Step 3: specify the building task
Specify a building task with a general description. Building task will help build manager (a LLM) decide what agents should be build.
Note that your building task should have a general description of the task. Adding some specific examples is better.
```python
building_task = "Find a paper on arxiv by programming, and analysis its application in some domain. For example, find a latest paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software."
```

### Step 4: build group chat agents
Use `build()` to let build manager (with a `builder_model` as backbone) complete the group chat agents generation.
If you think coding is necessary in your task, you can use `coding=True` to add a user proxy (a local code interpreter) into the agent list as:
```python
agent_list, agent_configs = builder.build(building_task, default_llm_config, coding=True)
```
If `coding` is not specified, AgentBuilder will determine on its own whether the user proxy should be added or not according to the task.

### Step 5: execute the task
Let agents generated in `build()` to complete the task collaboratively in a group chat.
```python
import autogen

def start_task(execution_task: str, agent_list: list, llm_config: dict):
    config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_path, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-1106-preview"]})

    group_chat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=agent_list, messages=[], max_round=12)
    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(
        groupchat=group_chat, llm_config={"config_list": config_list, **llm_config}
    )
    agent_list[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=execution_task)

start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
    llm_config=default_llm_config
)
```

### Step 6 (Optional): clear all agents and prepare for the next task
You can clear all agents generated in this task by the following code if your task is completed or the next task is largely different from the current task.
```python
builder.clear_all_agents(recycle_endpoint=True)
```
If the agent's backbone is an open-source LLM, this process will also shutdown the endpoint server. More details in the next section.
If necessary, you can use `recycle_endpoint=False` to retain the previous open-source LLM's endpoint server.

## Save and Load
You can save all necessary information of the built group chat agents by
```python
saved_path = builder.save()
```
Configs will be saved in the JSON format with following content:
```json
// FILENAME: save_config_TASK_MD5.json
{
    "building_task": "Find a paper on arxiv by programming, and analysis its application in some domain. For example, find a latest paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    "agent_configs": [
        {
            "name": "...",
            "model": "...",
            "system_message": "..."
        },
        ...
    ],
    "manager_system_message": "...",
    "coding": true,
    "default_llm_config": {
        "temperature": 0
    }
}
```
You can provide a specific filename, otherwise, AgentBuilder will save config to the current path with a generated filename `save_config_TASK_MD5.json`.

You can load the saved config and skip the building process. AgentBuilder will create agents with those information without prompting the build manager.
```python
new_builder = AgentBuilder(config_path=config_path)
agent_list, agent_config = new_builder.load(saved_path)
start_task(...)  # skip build()
```

## Use Open-source LLM
AutoBuild support open-source LLM by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).
Check the supported model list [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).
After satisfying the requirements, you can add an open-source LLM's huggingface repository to the config file,
```json,
// Add the LLM's huggingface repo to your config file and use EMPTY as the api_key.
[
    ...
    {
        "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf",
        "api_key": "EMPTY"
    }
]
```
and specify it when initializing AgentBuilder.
AgentBuilder will automatically set up an endpoint server for open-source LLM. Make sure you have sufficient GPUs resources.

## Use OpenAI Assistant
[Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications.
An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries.
AutoBuild also support assistant api by adding `use_oai_assistant=True` to `build()`.
```python
# Transfer to OpenAI Assistant API.
agent_list, agent_config = new_builder.build(building_task, default_llm_config, use_oai_assistant=True)
...
```

## Summary
We propose AutoBuild with a new class `AgentBuilder`.
AutoBuild can help user solve their complex task with an automatically built multi-agent system.
AutoBuild support open-source LLMs and GPTs api, giving users more flexibility to choose their favorite models.
