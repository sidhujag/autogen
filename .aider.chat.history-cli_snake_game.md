#### Please develop a basic version of a CLI-based snake game that prioritizes fundamental functionality, including snake movement and growth mechanics when collecting objects. Use keyboard controls for navigation.  

To create a basic CLI-based snake game, we will need to create a new Python file that will handle the game logic, rendering, and user input. Let's call this file `snake_game.py`. The game will use the `curses` library to handle keyboard input and rendering in the terminal.

Here is the diff for the new `snake_game.py` file:

```diff

+
+    # Move the snake
+    if key == curses.KEY_DOWN:
+        new_head[0] += 1
+    if key == curses.KEY_UP:
+        new_head[0] -= 1
+    if key == curses.KEY_LEFT:
+        new_head[1] -= 1
+    if key == curses.KEY_RIGHT:
+        new_head[1] += 1
+
+    # Insert the new head of the snake
+    snake.insert(0, new_head)
+
+    # Check if snake got the food
+    if snake[0] == food:
+        food = None
+        while food is None:
+            nf = [
+                random.randint(1, sh-1),
+                random.randint(1, sw-1)
+            ]
+            food = nf if nf not in snake else None
+        w.addch(food[0], food[1], curses.ACS_PI)
+    else:
+        tail = snake.pop()
+        w.addch(int(tail[0]), int(tail[1]), ' ')
+
+    w.addch(int(snake[0][0]), int(snake[0][1]), curses.ACS_CKBOARD)
```

This code initializes the game window, creates the snake and food, and contains the main game loop that handles user input, snake movement, collision detection, and food consumption. When the snake eats the food, it grows by not removing the tail segment. If the snake runs into the screen border or itself, the game ends.

#### Create a basic CLI snake game using Python which includes the game loop, state updates, handling user input for snake direction, and score tracking.  

To create a basic CLI snake game in Python, I will provide the necessary code changes to the `snake_game.py` file. The game will include a game loop, state updates, handling user input for snake direction, and score tracking.

This diff represents the entire content of a new `snake_game.py` file, which implements a basic CLI snake game. The game uses the `curses` library to handle the terminal screen, keyboard input, and rendering of the game elements. The snake moves in the terminal window, and the player can control its direction using the arrow keys. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself, and the final score is displayed.
