#### Create the backbone for a simple CLI Snake game in Python. This should include initializing the game board, the snake entity, and the movement controls using the arrow keys. Implement basic movement rules for the snake to move up, down, left, or right. Also, implement a mechanism for randomly placing food items on the board that the snake can collect.  

To create the backbone for a simple CLI Snake game in Python, I will create a new file named `snake_game.py`. This file will include the initialization of the game board, the snake entity, movement controls using the arrow keys, and a mechanism for randomly placing food items on the board.

This code initializes a new game board, places food randomly, and allows the snake to move in response to arrow key inputs. The snake is represented by a list of tuples, each tuple representing a segment of the snake. The game board is printed to the terminal using the curses library, which also captures the arrow key inputs for controlling the snake's direction. The game loop continues indefinitely until the program is manually stopped.

#### Begin coding the CLI Snake game. Implement basic features like snake movement, food collection, and collision detection. Write the code in Python and make sure it operates in a standard terminal environment.  

To implement the basic features of the CLI Snake game, such as snake movement, food collection, and collision detection, I will modify the existing `snake_game.py` file. The changes will include:

1. Updating the `main` function to handle snake movement and collision detection.
2. Adding a check to grow the snake when it eats food.
3. Adding a game over condition when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

Here are the diffs for those changes:

+        print_board(stdscr, board)

These changes will implement the basic functionality for the snake game, including movement, food collection, and collision detection. The game will end if the snake hits the wall or itself.

#### Please review the three implementations of the CLI Snake game in the `snake_game.py` and consolidate them into a single coherent codebase. Ensure that the final version includes non-blocking key reads, game state updates, and rendering to the console. The game should function properly with the ability to control the snake using arrow keys, collect food, and keep score.

1. Ensure non-blocking key reads are implemented.
2. Update the game state including the snake's movement, collision detection, and food collection.
